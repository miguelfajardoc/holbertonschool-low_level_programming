# 0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O
> Low-level programming & Algorithm â€•  Data structures and Algorithms

In this proyect we will learn which are the more commun sorting alghoritms, how to create and use in C
### Learning Objectives
-   At least four different sorting algorithms
-   What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
-   How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
-   What is a stable sorting algorithm
